README

Project was created using xCode 14.2, so you can find some warnings from newer versions. 

I use TCA as main architecture pattern. 

I use not stable implementation of ComposableCoreLocation. Because it wasn't updated to be compatible with TCA 1.0 and higher. 
Info about used implementation in this PR: https://github.com/pointfreeco/composable-core-location/pull/29

I've commited API_KEY to git to make this project run without additional settings.(I know that's bad idea)
